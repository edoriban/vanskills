# Frontend Design

This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI aesthetics." Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a **BOLD** aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Intentionality is key.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. 
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Roboto, and Inter.
- Opt for distinctive choices that elevate aesthetics. 
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. 
- Use CSS variables for consistency. 
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

### Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. 
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. 
- Use Motion library for React when available. 
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals.

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts: Asymmetry, Overlap, Diagonal flow. 
- Grid-breaking elements. 
- Generous negative space OR controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. 
- Add contextual effects: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

## What to Avoid
- **Generic AI Aesthetics**: Overused font families (Inter, system fonts), cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white), predictable layouts.
- **Predictable Patterns**: Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.
